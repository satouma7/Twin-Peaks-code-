2. 
The folder contains the following MATLAB scripts for the numerical simulations of the proneural wave. 

proneuralwave4original.m: original four variable model (Fig.1e)

proneuralwave4step.m: four variable model with step function (Fig.1f, 2b)

proneuralwave4stepPhase.m: Phase diagram of four variable model with step function (Supplementary Fig.1)

proneuralwave4hill.m: four variable model with Hill function (Fig.1g, 2c)

proneuralwave4hillPhase.m: Phase diagram of four variable model with Hill function (Supplementary Fig.2)

proneuralwave5hill.m: five variable model with Hill function (related to Supplementary Fig.12)

2. BshRun_quantification folder
3. 
The folder contains the MATLAB script and csv data files to quantify the overlap between Bsh- and Run-domains

BshRun_overlap.m: quantify the overlap between Bsh- and Run-domains (Fig. 7g-i)

Dlx_yyy_zzz.csv: Dl RNAi (x=0-3)

vpsx_yyy_zzz.csv: vps2 RNAi (x=0-3)

  yyy: Bsh or Run zzz: ctrl or mut
